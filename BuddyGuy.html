    <p class="text-center center-block">As far as I'm concerned, Buddy Guy is the greatest blues guitarist in the world. I had the privilege to see him play
        live and it was one of the best performances I've ever seen. During one of his songs, a string on his guitar snapped.
        Mr. Guy didn't skip a beat. He grabbed the broken string and started whirling it to hit the other strings on his
        guitar and just kept on playing like nothing happened. Did I mention that his licks were still crisp, clear, and
        moving? All while playing the remaining strings with the broken one string. He was a master at playing to the crowd,
        even taking the time to walk through the aisles of the performance space while he was playing. Everyone fortunate
        enough to be there that night seemed to be enjoying themselves. I consider myself luck to have had the privilege
        to see and hear Mr. Guy play live.
